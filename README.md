## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ˜„ I'm Alberto, a Software Engineering student at the Autonomous University of Baja California.
ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning about the C and Java programming language, algorithms, structured data, and object-oriented programming.

âš¡ I enjoy drinking coffee, tasting wine, and taking pictures of nature.
